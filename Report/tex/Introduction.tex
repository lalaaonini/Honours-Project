\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Introduction}
Amidst international pressure on countries to reduce their carbon footprints \cite{E-comm} and the British public's becoming increasingly frustrated by rising energy bills with little to no explanation as to the reasons behind the increases \cite{E-spending}, the UK Government is currently executing a plan to distribute smart meters to households across the country by 2020. Smart meters, which measure a household's gas and electricity consumption in real-time and regularly communicate the readings  directly to the utility companies, are expected to help households reduce energy usage by displaying how much energy is actually being used. They should also increase transparency in the household's energy bills by eliminating the need for monthly meter readings and estimations by the energy providers. Instead, the energy companies will be sent documented accountings of their customers' real consumption, and as a result, will be able invoice more accurately.

While there has generally been strong support for the smart meter program, there has also been resistance to the campaign, with fears that the energy companies will use the information as an opportunity to raise their customers' bills and increase their own profits \cite{stop}. Perhaps more interestingly though, and therefore the focus of this project, are concerns that have been raised regarding the security risks associated with measuring and storing energy consumption data \cite{Quinn} \cite{LMW}. Specifically, how much other information about a household can be inferred from energy consumption readings? 

In looking to answer whether these fears are well-founded, the aim of this project is to explore whether (and to what extent) it is
possible to construct features that predict detailed personal information about a household based on its energy consumption readings, and if so, if the results would be reliable. Breach of privacy issues would include whether such intrusive knowledge of household habits could effectively be exploited for targeted marketing or advertising campaigns, Big Brother-type government “watching”, or equally if not more maliciously, for timing burglaries or other crimes. 

Using electricity consumption information collected by the Household Electricity Survey (HES), a DEFRA\footnote{Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs} sponsored national survey of energy use collected over a period from 2010 to 2011, classification models are created to predict two properties of households: (1) The presence (or absence) of and (2) the Ipsos MORI social grade of the chief income earner. These properties are chosen because, of all the information gathered by the HES survey, they would logically be of interest to someone who might wish to intrude on a household.

This project has 3 main components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clean the data and create a database that stores the house sets and relevant household and energy-use information;
\item Extract useful features from the data that can be used as inputs to a classification model; 
\item Predict household properties using supervised learning methods.
\end{enumerate}

It should be noted that although the terms \textit{electricity, power} and \textit{energy} are not synonymous, within the context of this paper, they all refer to the electrical power consumed by a household and are therefore used interchangeably. 


\section{Smart Meters}
Following the example of EU Countries such as Italy, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and Germany \cite{OfGEM}\cite{Vasc}, 
\section{Related Work}
In recent years researchers have been putting much effort into it in focusing on N I LM (nonintrusive load of monitoring)Using aggregated electricity readings from households researchers tackle the problem of disaggregating thisBad consumption into its constituent appliances.
