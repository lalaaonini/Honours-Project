he discriminative approach is appealing
in that it is directly modelling what we want,
$p(y|\textbf{x})$. Also, density estimation for the class-conditional distributions is a hard problem, particularly when $\textbf{x}$ is high dimensional, so if we are just interested in classification then the generative approach may mean that we are trying to solve a harder problem than we need to\cite{Williams}. We are also fortunate in that there is no missing data.
