The files in this directory are used for testing.

Once the data has been stored the database called hes_database in the appliance_group_data table, a subset of households can be extracted using createTestHouseholds.py. This chooses 10 households at random and inserts their raw data into the apg_test table.           

Hopefully, all files in this directory will have a counterpart without the _subset suffix (other than createTestHouseholds.py) which are to be used on the full dataset to do the pre-prossessing.

---WHAT ORDER TO DO STUFF IN------

1) run createTestHouseholds.py
2) run MakeHouseSets_Subset.py
3) run dropEmptyTables_subset.py
4) run chopTopsOff_subset.py
5) create a database called Ten_Mins_Subset
6) run to10MinIntervals_subset.py
7) create a database called Total_Profile_Monthly_Subset
8) run split_into_ID3_Subset.py
9) run split_into_ID1_Subset.py (you dont need _ID2 because ID3 appears to contain the ID2 data)
